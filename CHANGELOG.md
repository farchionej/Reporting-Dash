- "Customer Inquiries" groups: inquire_now, inquiry, request_info, contact_us
- "Table Service" is a display suffix for reservation campaigns, not a separate metric

## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-14

### Parser Intelligence Upgrade
- **Unified Number Formatting System**

- **Intelligent Email Generation**
  - Metric priority scoring (Phone Calls: 100, Directions: 95, Views: 30)
  - Local intent metrics prioritized over vanity metrics
  - Context-aware growth filtering (ignores 2‚Üí10 = +400% as meaningless)
  - Geographic relevance scoring (home market > distant spikes)
  - Absolute value + percentage for true impact assessment

  - Prioritizes business-driving metrics

- **Geographic Intelligence**
  - Auto-detect home market from restaurant name
  - Home territory changes always relevant (even small %)
  - Non-home markets need both volume AND growth
  - Score-based relevance filtering (60+ threshold)
  - Example: Nashville 2,466 users +19% > Birmingham 1,080 users +151%

- **Enhanced Value Parsing**
  - Handles: ‚Äî, N/A, ‚àû, +100%, 1.2K, 1.5M, New, multiple values
  - Special character normalization (üü©‚Üípositive, ‚¨Ü‚Üíup)
  - Unicode to ASCII conversion
  - Robust percentage extraction

### Technical Improvements
