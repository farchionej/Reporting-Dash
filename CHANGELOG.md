# Changelog

All notable changes to Reporting Dash will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-01-14

### Fixed
- **Added Missing Metrics to Priority System**
  - Customer Inquiries: 75 (high-value engagement metric)
  - Catering Requests: 70 (high-value leads)
  - Information Requests: 65 (general inquiries)
  - Direction Requests: 95 (local intent variant)
  - Contact Form: 50 (engagement)
  - Gift Cards: 45 (transaction-related)

### Context
- These metrics existed in the normalization/grouping system but were missing from the intelligent email generation priority scoring
- Now properly prioritized in email reports based on local intent value
- "Customer Inquiries" groups: inquire_now, inquiry, request_info, contact_us
- "Table Service" is a display suffix for reservation campaigns, not a separate metric

## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-14

### Parser Intelligence Upgrade
- **Unified Number Formatting System**
  - Smart rounding: 1.2K for 1,234 | 55K for 55,393 | $4.9K for $4,946
  - Context-aware formatting: currency, percentages, ratings, time
  - Consistent display across KPIs, emails, charts, tables
  - Percentages: whole numbers for 10%+, 1 decimal for <10%
  - Tabular numerals for better alignment

- **Intelligent Email Generation**
  - Metric priority scoring (Phone Calls: 100, Directions: 95, Views: 30)
  - Local intent metrics prioritized over vanity metrics
  - Context-aware growth filtering (ignores 2â†’10 = +400% as meaningless)
  - Geographic relevance scoring (home market > distant spikes)
  - Absolute value + percentage for true impact assessment

- **Smart Metric Filtering**
  - High-priority metrics: lower volume threshold (50+)
  - Medium-priority: require 200+ volume
  - Low-priority: require 500+ volume
  - Filters out "vanity growth" (high % on tiny numbers)
  - Prioritizes business-driving metrics

- **Geographic Intelligence**
  - Auto-detect home market from restaurant name
  - Home territory changes always relevant (even small %)
  - Non-home markets need both volume AND growth
  - Score-based relevance filtering (60+ threshold)
  - Example: Nashville 2,466 users +19% > Birmingham 1,080 users +151%

- **Enhanced Value Parsing**
  - Handles: â€”, N/A, âˆž, +100%, 1.2K, 1.5M, New, multiple values
  - Special character normalization (ðŸŸ©â†’positive, â¬†â†’up)
  - Unicode to ASCII conversion
  - Robust percentage extraction

### Technical Improvements
- New formatting utilities: formatNumber, formatCurrency, formatRating, formatTime, formatChange
- parseAndNormalizeValue for robust input handling
- calculateMetricImpactScore for intelligent prioritization
- shouldMentionGrowth logic prevents irrelevant insights
- scoreGeographicInsight for location-based filtering
- detectHomeMarket mapping for 8+ restaurant markets
